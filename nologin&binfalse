what is the difference between a login shell between /bin/false and /sbin/nologin?

to check what will happen,i create two users:nologin and binfalse with a login shell of /sbin/nologin and /bin/false respectively.

result :
[root@nas ~]# ssh nologin@localhost
nologin@localhost's password:
This account is currently not available.
Connection to localhost closed.

[root@nas ~]# ssh binfale@localhost
binfale@localhost's password:
Permission denied, please try again.

/sbin/nologin will show that this account is not available 
/bin/false just let server think that the authentication of the user and his password failed anyway,which will be always a "permission denied"
